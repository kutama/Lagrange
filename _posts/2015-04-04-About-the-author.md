Hi there! I'm Chamu from Kutama , the community not the school. Iâ€™m a math grad turned software enegineer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for maths course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. 

### Jekyll Website Theme.

I am using minimalist Jekyll blog theme , a sample git and Jekyll project for 2nd formers. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for a publication or blog.

On this space a learning system shall be built over the next weeks and months for Kutama.space students to offer courses in Computer science and Maths. The courses include - Object-oriented programming , Introduction to Python for 3rd and 4th formers , Advanced python programming for 5th formers , Java programming for 4th formers , developing algorithms , games development for 4th formers , Embedded programming for 5th formers , Maths applications in computer science among many.

If you have a question , ping me at norton@kutama.space
