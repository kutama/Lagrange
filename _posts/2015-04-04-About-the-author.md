Hi there! I'm Chamu from Kutama , the community not the school. Iâ€™m a math grad turned software enegineer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for maths course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. 

On this space an interactive learning system shall be built over the next weeks and months for Kutama.space students to offer courses in Computer science and Maths. The courses include - Object-oriented programming , Introduction to Python for 3rd and 4th formers , Advanced python programming for 5th formers , Java programming for 5th formers , developing algorithms , games development for 4th formers , Embedded programming for 5th formers , Maths applications in computer science, among many courses.

If you have a question , ping me at nortonsville@kutama.space
